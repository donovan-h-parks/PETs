- There are 68 taxa
  - All trees have at least 66 taxa

- Number of well-supported splits increases with sequence length (roughly linear)
  - As such, short sequences have few well-supported splits and are congruent with many trees
  - Suggest clustering should treat these 'hub' nodes as unassignable
  - Perhaps fuzzy clustering would work here since 'hub' nodes would be assigned to many clusters

- Number of consistent gene trees increases with bootstrap threshold
  - Results in an increased number of edges in graph
  
- Maximum clique changes substantially under different bootstrap thresholds
  - This is bad - perhaps not the best way to cluster the data
  - A given node could be in multiple cliques (removing maximum clique ignores this fact)
