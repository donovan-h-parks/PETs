Installation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PETs is a command-line program written in C++.  To install PETs, download and 
uncompress it with the unzip command:
  unzip PETs_1_0_0.zip

To compile PETs on OSX or Linux simply type 'make' from within the source directory 
of PETs. The resulting executable will be in the bin directory. A precompiled 
executables for Windows is provided in the bin directory. Please note that even 
under Windows, Network Diversity must be run from the command-line (i.e., the DOS 
prompt).


Program usage:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage: Network Diversity [OPTIONS]
Calculates taxon- and phylogenetic-basec beta diversity measures.

Options:
 -h, --help           Produce help message.
 -l, --list-calc      List all supported calculators.
 -u, --unit-tests     Execute unit tests.
 
 -c, --calculator     Desired calculator (e.g., Bray-Curtis, Canberra).
 -w, --weighted       Indicated if sequence abundance data should be used.
 -y, --count          Use count data as opposed to relative proportions.

 -n, --nexus-file     Nexus input file (must contain a Taxa and Splits block, root split system with Outgroup taxa).
 -t, --newick-file    Newick input file (tree treated as implicitly rooted).
 -s, --sample-file    Sample file indicating number of times each sequences is found in a sample.
 -o, --output-file    Output file.

 -x, --max-data-vecs  Maximum number of profiles (data vectors) to have in memory at once (default = 1000).

 -v, --verbose        Provide additional information on program execution.

Examples of Use:
 ./NetworkDiversity -n input.nex -s seq.txt -o output.txt -c Bray-Curtis -w
 ./NetworkDiversity -t input.tre -s seq.txt -o output.txt -c Bray-Curtis -w
  
Verifying software installation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A set of unit tests is included to verify proper installation of the Network 
Diversity software. The unit tests can be run with:
  ./NetworkDiversity -u

The software should not be used if any of the unit tests fail.

Input file formats:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Network Diversity uses Newick trees and Nexus split systems as input. Information 
on the Newick tree format can be found at: 
  http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html.
  
Here is a simple Newick tree with three leaf nodes labelled A, B, and C:
 (A:1,(B:1,C:1):1);
 
Trees or split systems containing incompatible splits can be specified using
the Nexus format. Network Diversity is compatible with Nexus files generated
by SplitsTree (http://www.splitstree.org/). In particular, Network Diversity
requires a Taxa and Splits block.

Sequence count information must be specified as a tab-delimited table where
each row is a sample and each column is the name of a leaf node in the provided
tree. Data must be provided for all leaf nodes in the tree. Consider the 
following example:

	A	B	C
Sample1	1	2	3
Sample2	10	1	0
Sample3	0	0	1

The first row is a tab seperate list of the taxa present in the tree or split 
system. Please note that this line MUST start with a tab. The number of sequences 
associated with each taxa is then indicated for each sample on a seperate
row. In this example, the first sample is labelled 'Sample1' and contains 1
instance of taxa A, 2 instances of B, and 3 instances of C. Sample3
contains only instances of C, but note that zeros must be specified for the
other taxa.

Example input files are avaliable in the unit-tests directory. 

Output file format:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The resulting dissimilarity between samples is written as a tab-delimited, 
lower-triangular dissimilarity matrix with the first line indicating the number
of samples. Consider the following output:

3
A
B	1
C	2	3

The first line indicates that there are 3 samples. The dissimilarity between 
samples A and B is 1, A and C is 2, and B and C is 3.
